## Welcome to my GitHub Page for IE423

Hello again and again :) I'm H. Emre Bacak -as you already know if you started reading this page from the beginning-
I'm a senior industrial engineering student at Bogazici University. Thanks to our professor and teaching assistant, I've created this beautiful GitHub Page to demonstrate and organize my work related to IE423. Hopefully, I will utilize this page and fill it up with my successful assignments :)
